Answer: A standardized severity metric (0â€“10 scale) to rate vulnerabilities.

Question: Scan frequency
Answer: Monthly and after significant system changes or security incidents.

Question: False positives
Answer: Incorrect alerts; managed via manual verification, tuning, and cross-tool validation.

Question: Prioritizing vulnerabilities
